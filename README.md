# Generate job summary from Nox report

If you use [Nox](https://github.com/wntrblm/nox) to test or otherwise
handle your project in an Actions workflow, this action can create a
[job summary](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-commands-for-github-actions#adding-a-job-summary)
for you, based on the JSON report generated by Nox.

The summary might look like this:

> ## Nox
> 
> * lint: success :heavy_check_mark:
> * typecheck: success :heavy_check_mark:
> * test-3.9: skipped :large_blue_circle:
> * test-3.10: success :heavy_check_mark:
> * test-3.11: skipped :large_blue_circle:
> * coverage: success :heavy_check_mark:

Each Nox session is listed with its status and a matching symbol.

## Usage example

```yaml
- name: Set up Nox
  uses: wntrblm/nox@2022.8.7
- name: Run Nox
  run: |
    nox --report test-report.json
- name: Create job summary
  uses: airtower-luna/nox-report-to-job-summary@v1.0.0
  with:
    report: test-report.json
```

This action requires the `python` binary to be a Python 3 interpreter.
Using any of the `actions/setup-python` or `wntrblm/nox` (which calls
`actions/setup-python` in turn) actions before this one is sufficient.

## Arguments

* `report`: The report file you want to use, as generated by `nox
  --report FILE.json`

* `title`: The title you want the summary to have, defaults to "Nox".
